# Lang-graph-project

Lang-graph-project is a repository designed to explore, implement, and demonstrate concepts related to agent algorithms that connect linguistic elements or computational tasks using graph-based models.

## Features

- Graph-based representations of language or computational workflows
- Algorithms for traversing, analyzing, or manipulating language graphs
- Example scripts and notebooks for demonstrations
- Modular and extensible codebase for experimentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher recommended
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for dependency management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kardwalker/Lang-graph-project.git
   cd Lang-graph-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Explore the example scripts in the `examples/` directory:

```bash
python examples/example_script.py
```

Or run your own code using the provided modules.
